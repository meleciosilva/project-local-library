# Local Library

This project makes retrieving library information on accounts, books, and authors more accessible. I used several JavaScript array methods to extract pertinent data from objects including the following: find(), filter(), map(), indexOf(), join(), reduce(), and more. More importantly, I learned how to effectively access nested data and how to refactor my code using object shorthand, spread operators, and destructuring techniques.
